# PowerShell
A location for all my custom PowerShell scripts.
These sript have been written by myself with help from various sources online.

Feel free to use any of these scripts as needed. Make sure you know what the script
is doing before you run it. Some of these make changes while others are just reports.

Feel free to check out my blog for some examples and stories: https://evandottech.wordpress.com
