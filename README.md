# PowerShell Home
A location for my custom PowerShell scripts to live and have source control.
This repository is a combination of scripts written by me, scripts modified by me, and 1st party Microsoft scripts.
Any scripts that have been edited from elsewhere will have proper credits in the first comments.

Feel free to use any of these scripts as needed, free of use. Please give credit where due.
Make sure you know what the script is doing before you run it. Some are reports, others make mass changes.
I am in no way responsible for any of the actions performed by your usage of these scripts.

Be aware, Microsoft is always changing things in the back-end and retiring modules/cmdlets.
Some of these scripts may not work depending on when they were last updated. I do not test these regularly.

Feel free to check out my blog for some examples and stories, I have not posted there in quite some time now: https://evandottech.wordpress.com
